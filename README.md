## Install

```bash
npm install react-live-route --save-dev
```

## About

It can keeps component of route hidden (alive) instead of unmout when the path is not match. There are a few APIs provided to control the life cycle of component.

ExampleÔºö

We have a list page, click on the items in the list page will enter the details page, when entering the details page, the list page will be hidden, when returning to the list page, the list page will revert to the last time you left.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Fully compatible with react-router-4, all passed the react-router-v4 unit tests.
- üì¶ Completely restored the last time you left the page (scroll position included).
- üéØ Minimally invasive, all you need to do is importing a LiveRoute.
- ‚úåÔ∏è Blazing easy API.

## API

### livePath

`livePath` is the path of the page that needs to be hidden. The specific rules are the same as `path` props of Route in react-router-v4. Use `component` or `render` to

Example:

The route of List will be rendered normally under `/list`, and it will be hidden when entering `/user/:id`, and it will be unmounted normally when entering  other pages.

```jsx
import LiveRoute from 'react-live-route'

<LiveRoute path="/list" livePath="/user/:id" component={List}/>
```

### alwaysLive

`alwaysLive` will block the unmount life cycle under other unmatched pages after the corresponding component of the route completes the first mount.

Example: 

After the first normal rendering, the Modal page is hidden when the path is not matched, and will be re-render when match again.

```jsx
import LiveRoute from 'react-live-route'

<LiveRoute path="/list" alwaysLive={true} component={Modal}/>
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveat

- If a route uses LiveRoute and the parent route of the current route is unmounted, then whether or not the LiveRoute is the current matching livePath will be unmounted. This is determined by the top-down design principle of React. You can use LiveRoute to declares a parent route to solve this problem.
- LiveRoute should not be wrapped by `Switch` directly, because `Switch` only render the first matched component so that LiveRoute may not be rendered at all.
